# ShooterGame

## Introduction

The ShooterGame is my second project for my java course at my IT studies. It is the 2D shooter game in which you can play singleplayer or multiplayer (offline).

## How the game works

### Singleplayer

The singleplayer mode consist three levels which every level takes place on different map (House, Storehouse and Desert). 

#### Playey

As a player you can move in four directions and shoot. You have also five hearts (every hit from the enemy takes one heart). If you lose all your hearts you die.

#### Enemies

There are three types of enemies zombie, robot and solider.

The amount of enemies on the map depends on the level.

#### What exact enemy does?

Zombie is actually the weakest enemy, it has 5 hearts and it is really slow. Robot has only 3 hearts, but it moves a lot faster than zombie. This types of enemies will follow you if you go close to them or shoot them. The third enemy is solider who changes side it is looking at for every one second. If you stand in his looking direction, he will shoot (if you stand behind cover he won't see you). 

#### How do I win/lose?

You win if you kill all the enemies on the map. You lose when you die.

### Multiplayer

In the multiplayer mode you play 1 vs 1 with other person on of the maps known from the silngeplayer (House, Storehouse and Desert). The aim is to kill the second player. Unlike in singleplayer, in multiplayer player can pick up one power-ups.

#### Power-ups

There are four types of power-ups: heart, yerba, bullet and a gun.

#### What the exact power-up does?

Heart basically heals you. Yerba gives you bonus movement speed. Bullet increases you shooting speed. Gun increases your damage dealt to another player. All power-ups (except heart) last for 10 seconds.

#### When do a player win?

A player win when he kills another player.
