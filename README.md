# ShooterGame

## Introduction

The ShooterGame is my second project for my java course at my IT studies. It is the 2D shooter game in which you can play singleplayer or multiplayer (offline).

## How the game works

### Singleplayer

The singleplayer mode consist three levels which every level takes place on different map (House, Storehouse and Desert). 

There are three types of enemies: 
-zombie
-robot
-solider

The amount of enemies on the map depends on the level. Zombie is actually the weakest enemy, it has 5 hearts and it is really slow. Robot has only 3 hearts, but it moves a lot faster than zombie. This types of enemies will follow you if you go close to them or shoot them. The third enemy is solider who changes side it is looking at for every one second. If you stand in his looking direction, he will shoot (if you stand behind cover he won't see you). You win if you kill all the enemies on the map.

### Multiplayer

In the multiplayer mode you play 1 vs 1 with other person on of the maps known from the silngeplayer (House, Storehouse and Desert). The aim is to kill the ike in singleplayer, in multiplayer player can pick up one power-ups.
